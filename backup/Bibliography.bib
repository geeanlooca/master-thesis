abstract = {A novel technique for axial resolution improvement of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) systems is proposed. The technique is based on step-frequency encoding, using frequency shifting, of the OCT signal. A resolution improvement by a factor of approximately 7 is achieved without the need for a broader bandwidth light source. This method exploits a combination of two basic principles: the appearance of beating, when adding two signals of slightly different carrier frequencies, and the resolution improvement by deconvolution of the interferogram with an encoded autocorrelation function. In time domain OCT, step-frequency encoding can be implemented by performing two scans, with different carrier frequencies, and subsequently adding them to create the encoded signal. When the frequency steps are properly selected, deconvolution of the resulting interferogram, using appropriate kernels, results in a narrower resolution width.},

Both theoretical analysis and experimental comparison are presented. The results show that interpixel shifted SDOCT can not only double the depth of field of SDOCT image but also eliminate the artifacts induced by aliasing effect, thus improving image contrast in areas with large depths (e.g., Delta z {\textgreater} or = 1.5 mm). If combined with endoscopic OCT, this technique has the potential to enhance in vivo diagnosis of biological tissues that require a larger field of view in the axial direction, such as cartilage degeneration and bladder tumors with deep asperities or invaginations.},

abstract = {A technique called optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been developed for noninvasive cross-sectional imaging in biological systems. OCT uses low-coherence interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal tissue microstructures in a way that is analogous to ultrasonic pulse-echo imaging. OCT has longitudinal and lateral spatial resolutions of a few micrometers and can detect reflected signals as small as {\~{}}10 −10 of the incident optical power. Tomographic imaging is demonstrated in vitro in the peripapillary area of the retina and in the coronary artery, two clinically relevant examples that are representative of transparent and turbid media, respectively. Tomographic imaging techniques such as x-ray computed tomography (1), magnetic resonance imaging (2), and ultrasound imaging (3) have found widespread applications in medicine. Each of these techniques measures a different physical property and has a resolution and penetration range that prove advantageous for specific applications. In this report, we discuss OCT. With this technique it is possible to perform noninvasive cross-sectional imaging of internal structures in biological tissues by measuring their optical reflections.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the current state of research in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT). SDOCT is an interferometric technique that provides depth-resolved tissue structure information encoded in the magnitude and delay of the back-scattered light by spectral analysis of the interference fringe pattern. There are two approaches to SDOCT--one that uses a broadband source and a spectrometer to measure the interference pattern as a function of wavelength and the other that utilizes a narrowband tunable laser that is swept linearly in k approximately 1/lambda space during spectral fringe data acquisition. Unlike time domain (TD) OCT, the reference arm is stationary in both SDOCT methods, which allows for ultra high-speed OCT imaging. Owing to its high speed and superior sensitivity, SDOCT has become indispensable in biomedical imaging applications. After a brief introduction and a discussion on sensitivity advantage, methods of implementation of the two SDOCT schemes will be presented. The two peer approaches are compared in speed, scan depth range, complexity, spectral regions of operation, and methods of detection. The review also discusses OCT enhancements and functional methods based on SDOCT format and concludes with possible directions that this research may take in the near future.},

abstract = {OCT functions as a type of optical biopsy, providing information on retinal pathology in situ and in real time, with resolutions approaching that of excisional biopsy and histopathology. The development of ultrabroad-bandwidth and tunable light sources, as well as high-speed Fourier detection techniques, has enabled a significant improvement in ophthalmic optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging performance. Three-dimensional, ultrahigh-resolution OCT (UHR OCT) can provide information on intraretinal morphology that is not available from any other non-invasive diagnostic. High-speed imaging facilitates the acquisition of three-dimensional data sets (3D-OCT), thus enabling volumetric rendering and the generation of OCT fundus images that precisely and reproducibly register OCT images to fundus features. The development of broadband light sources emitting at new wavelengths, e.g., ∼1050 nm, has enabled not only 3D-OCT imaging with enhanced choroidal visualization, but also reduced scattering losses and improved OCT performance in cataract patients. Adaptive optics using high-stroke, deformable mirror technology to correct higher order aberrations in the human eye, in combination with specially designed optics to compensate chromatic aberration along with three-dimensional UHR OCT, has recently enabled in vivo cellular-resolution retinal imaging. In addition, extensions of OCT have been developed to enhance image contrast and to enable non-invasive depth-resolved functional imaging of the retina, thus providing blood flow, spectroscopic, polarization-sensitive and physiological information. Functional OCT promises to enable the differentiation of retinal pathologies via localized, functional retinal response or metabolic properties. These advances promise to have a powerful impact on fundamental as well as clinical studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Noninvasive microvascular imaging using optical coherence Doppler tomography (ODT) has shown great promise in brain studies; however, high-speed microcirculatory imaging in deep brain remains an open quest. A high-speed 1.3mum swept-source ODT (SS-ODT) system is reported which was based on a 200kHz vertical-cavity-surface-emitting laser. Phase errors induced by sweep-trigger desynchronization were effectively reduced by spectral phase encoding and instantaneous correlation among the A-scans. Phantom studies have revealed a significant reduction in phase noise, thus an enhancement of minimally detectable flow down to 268.2mum/s. Further in vivo validation was performed, in which 3D cerebral-blood-flow (CBF) networks in mouse brain over a large field-of-view (FOV: 8.5x5x3.2mm3) was scanned through thinned skull. Results showed that fast flows up to 3cm/s in pial vessels and minute flows down to 0.3mm/s in arterioles or venules were readily detectable at depths down to 3.2mm. Moreover, the dynamic changes of the CBF networks elicited by acute cocaine such as heterogeneous responses in various vessel compartments and at different cortical layers as well as transient ischemic events were tracked, suggesting the potential of SS-ODT for brain functional imaging that requires high flow sensitivity and dynamic range, fast frame rate and a large FOV to cover different brain regions},

abstract = {Advances in swept source laser technology continues to increase the imaging speed of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) systems. These fast imaging speeds are ideal for microvascular detection schemes, such as speckle variance (SV), where interframe motion can cause severe imaging artifacts and loss of vascular contrast. However, full utilization of the laser scan speed has been hindered by the computationally intensive signal processing required by SS-OCT and SV calculations. Using a commercial graphics processing unit that has been optimized for parallel data processing, we report a complete high-speed SS-OCT platform capable of real-time data acquisition, processing, display, and saving at 108,000 lines per second. Subpixel image registration of structural images was performed in real-time prior to SV calculations in order to reduce decorrelation from stationary structures induced by the bulk tissue motion. The viability of the system was successfully demonstrated in a high bulk tissue motion scenario of human fingernail root imaging where SV images (512 × 512 pixels, n = 4) were displayed at 54 frames per second.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a volume rendering application for multimodal datasets based on 3D texture mapping. Our method takes as input two pre-registered voxel models and constructs two 3D textures. It renders the multimodal data by depth compositing view-aligned texture slices of the model. For each texel of a slice, it performs a fetch to each 3D texture and performs fusion and shading using a fragment shader. The application allows users to choose either emission and absorption shading or surface shading for each model. Shading is implemented by using two auxiliary 1D textures for each transfer function. Moreover, data fusion takes into account the presence of surfaces and the specific values that are merged, so that the weight of each modality in fusion is not constant but defined through a 2D transfer function implemented as a 2D texture. This method is very fast and versatile and it provides a good insight into multimodal data. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To compare optical coherence tomography (OCT) images obtained with swept-source OCT (SS-OCT) and spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) in pathological myopia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: This is a comparative observational cases series. Five patients with pathological myopia underwent SD-OCT and SS-OCT imaging. SS-OCT was performed using a prototype system (Topcon Medical Systems). SD-OCT was performed using enhanced depth imaging on the Heidelberg Spectralis OCT. The closest corresponding scans from the central subfield were compared.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Eight eyes of five patients with pathological myopia were included (mean spherical equivalent: -16.00 ± 4.70 D). Overall, SS-OCT better visualized retino-choroidal structures. The choroid, inner segment (IS)/outer segment (OS) line, and external limiting membrane (ELM) were clearly seen in a higher proportion of SS-OCT than SD-OCT scans, (P{\textless}0.01 for all) whereas visualization of the sclera and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were similar. SS-OCT demonstrated foveoschisis in four eyes, with one of these not visible on SD-OCT. The wider SS-OCT scan revealed additional pathology not visible using SD-OCT along the staphyloma walls in 4/8 images. These included incomplete posterior vitreous detachment in one eye and peripheral retinoschisis in 3/8 eyes. Vitreoschisis was visible in 3/8 SS-OCT images but not in the SD-OCT images.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: SS-OCT is useful for imaging the posterior staphyloma of pathological myopia, providing greater detail than SD-OCT.},

In one configuration, the system acquires, processes and visualizes 26 volumes per second where each volume consists of 320 x 320 depth scans and each depth scan has 400 usable pixels. This is the fastest real-time OCT to date in terms of voxel rate. A 51 Hz volume rate is realized with half the frame number. In both configurations the speed can be sustained indefinitely. The OCT system uses a 1310 nm Fourier domain mode locked (FDML) laser operated at 3.2 MHz sweep rate. Data acquisition is performed with two dedicated digitizer cards, each running at 2.5 GS/s, hosted in a single desktop computer. Live real-time data processing and visualization are realized with custom developed software on an NVidia GTX 690 dual graphics processing unit (GPU) card.

Therefore the actual imaging speed is camera- limited to 128,000 line/s for 1024-OCT or 70,000 line/s for 2048-OCT. 3D Data sets are continuously acquired in real time at 1024-OCT mode, immediately processed and visualized as high as 10 volumes/second (12,500 A-scans/volume) by either en face slice extraction or ray-casting based volume rendering from 3D texture mapped in graphics memory. For standard FD-OCT systems, a GPU is the only additional hardware needed to realize this improvement and no optical modification is needed. This technique is highly cost-effective and can be easily integrated into most ultrahigh speed FD-OCT systems to overcome the 3D data processing and visualization bottlenecks.},

abstract = {We describe a simple and low-cost technique for resolving the complex conjugate ambiguity in Fourier domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) that is applicable to many swept source OCT (SSOCT) systems. First, we review the principles of coherence revival, wherein an interferometer illuminated by an external cavity tunable laser (ECTL) exhibits interference fringes when the two arms of the interferometer are mismatched by an integer multiple of the laser cavity length. Second, we report observations that the spectral interferogram obtained from SSOCT systems employing certain ECTLs are automatically phase modulated when the arm lengths are mismatched this way. This phase modulation results in a frequency-shifted interferogram, effectively creating an extended-depth heterodyne SSOCT system without the use of acousto-optic or electro-optic modulators. We suggest that this phase modulation may be caused by the ECTL cavity optical pathlength varying slightly over the laser sweep, and support this hypothesis with numerical simulations. We also report on the successful implementation of this technique with two commercial swept source lasers operating at 840nm and 1040nm, with sweep rates of 8kHz and 100kHz respectively. The extended imaging depth afforded by this technique was demonstrated by measuring the sensitivity fall-off profiles of each laser with matched and mismatched interferometer arms. The feasibility of this technique for clinical systems is demonstrated by imaging the ocular anterior segments of healthy human volunteers.},

Objective: To evaluate the use of intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) to assess the coronary arteries in patients undergoing coronary stenting. Methods: OCT was employed in patients having percutaneous coronary interventions. Images were obtained before initial balloon dilatation and following stent deployment, and were evaluated for vessel dissection, tissue prolapse, stent apposition, and stent asymmetry. IVUS images were obtained before OCT, using an automatic pull back device. Results: 42 stents were imaged in 39 patients without complications. Dissection, prolapse, and incomplete stent apposition were observed more often with OCT than with IVUS. Vessel dissection was identified in eight stents by OCT and two by IVUS. Tissue prolapse was identified in 29 stents by OCT and 12 by IVUS; the extent of the prolapse (mean (SD)) was 242 (156) μm by OCT and 400 (100) μm by IVUS. Incomplete stent apposition was observed in seven stents by OCT and three by IVUS. Irregular strut separation was identified in 18 stents by both OCT and IVUS. Conclusions: Intracoronary OCT for monitoring stent deployment is feasible and provides superior contrast and resolution of arterial pathology than IVUS.},

	abstract = {Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the ability of intravascular optical coherence tomography (OCT) to visualize the components of coronary plaques in living patients.Background Disruption of a vulnerable coronary plaque with subsequent thrombosis is currently recognized as the primary mechanism for acute myocardial infarction. Although such plaques are considered to have a thin fibrous cap overlying a lipid pool, imaging modalities in current clinical practice do not have sufficient resolution to identify thin (\&lt;65 μm) fibrous caps. Optical coherence tomography is a new imaging modality capable of obtaining cross-sectional images of coronary vessels at a resolution of approximately 10 μm.Methods The OCT images and corresponding histology of 42 coronary plaques were compared to establish OCT criteria for different types of plaques. Atherosclerotic lesions with mild to moderate stenosis were identified on angiograms in 10 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization. Optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images of these sites were obtained in all patients without complication.Results Comparison between OCT and histology demonstrated that lipid-rich plaques and fibrous plaques have distinct OCT characteristics. A total of 17 IVUS and OCT image pairs obtained from patients were compared. Axial resolution measured 13 {\textpm} 3 μm with OCT and 98 {\textpm} 19 μm with IVUS. All fibrous plaques, macrocalcifications and echolucent regions identified by IVUS were visualized in corresponding OCT images. Intimal hyperplasia and echolucent regions, which may correspond to lipid pools, were identified more frequently by OCT than by IVUS.Conclusions Intracoronary OCT appears to be feasible and safe. Optical coherence tomography identified most architectural features detected by IVUS and may provide additional detailed structural information.},

abstract="Diagnostic trends in medicine are being directed toward cellular and molecular processes, where treatment regimens are more amenable for cure. Optical imaging is capable of performing cellular and molecular imaging using the short wavelengths and spectroscopic properties of light. Diffuse optical tomography is an optical imaging technique that has been pursued as an alternative to X-ray mammography. While this technique permits non-invasive optical imaging of the whole breast, to date it is incapable of resolving features at the cellular level. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an emerging high-resolution biomedical imaging technology that for larger and undifferentiated cells can perform cellular-level imaging at the expense of imaging depth. OCT performs optical ranging in tissue and is analogous to ultrasound except reflections of near-infrared light are detected rather than sound. In this paper, an overview of the OCT technology is provided, followed by images demonstrating the feasibility of using OCT to image cellular features indicative of breast cancer. OCT images of a well-established carcinogen-induced rat mammary tumor model were acquired. Images from this common experimental model show strong correlation with corresponding histopathology. These results illustrate the potential of OCT for a wide range of basic research studies and for intra-operative image-guidance to identify foci of tumor cells within surgical margins during the surgical treatment of breast cancer.",

@article{Escobar2004,
abstract = {The purpose of this study was to understand the capabilities and utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in characterizing tissue in patients with precancer and cancer of the uterine cervix and vulva. OCT is an optical technique that uses low-coherence interferometer to develop a two-dimensional image of optical scattering from internal tissue microstructure. This study was designed to develop diagnostic criteria. Women undergoing colposcopic evaluation secondary to an abnormal Papanicolaou smear or visualized grossly abnormal vulvar lesion comprised the study population. Under colposcopic visualization, the OCT device was applied to normal regions in all patients and abnormal areas when present, and images were captured. Each subject then underwent multiple directed biopsies. Images were then reviewed and compared with matched histology. A total of 50 women were recruited for the study. Of the 50 patients evaluated, 18 had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II,III, 14 had CIN I, 13 had metaplasia/inflammation, two had invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, and three had a diagnosis of Paget's disease of the vulva. Analysis of the OCT images showed a repetitive pattern that represented normal squamous epithelium of the cervix in 100{\%} of the normal biopsies. Images of the 18 patients with histologically proven CIN II,III showed an unstructured homogeneous highly backscattering region with fast attenuation of the signal in 16 (89{\%}) of the patients. OCT is a new approach for the early identification of cervix and vulvar malignancies. Using information inherent to the returning photon signals from tissue, early morphological and light-scattering changes can be detected during tumorigenesis. It has the potential to be a true optical biopsy. If diagnostically comparable to a biopsy, then clearly the ability of OCT to provide a point of service diagnosis would serve a significant advantage.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a depth resolved imaging modality that may aid in identifying sun damaged skin and the precancerous condition actinic keratosis (AK). STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS OCT images were acquired of 112 patients at 2 sun protected and 2 sun exposed sites, with a subsequent biopsy. Each site received a dermatological evaluation, a histological diagnosis, and a solar elastosis (SE) score. OCT images were examined visually and statistically analyzed. RESULTS Characteristic OCT image features were identified of sun protected, undiseased, sun damaged, and AK skin. A statistically significant difference (P{\textless}0.0001) between the average attenuation values of skin with minimal and severe solar elastosis was observed. Significant differences (P{\textless}0.0001) were also found between undiseased skin and AK using a gradient analysis. Using image features, AK could be distinguished from undiseased skin with 86{\%} sensitivity and 83{\%} specificity. CONCLUSION OCT has the potential to guide biopsies and provide non-invasive measures of skin sun damage and disease state, possibly increasing efficiency of chemopreventive agent trials.},

abstract = {Optical coherence tomography provides sections of tissues in a noncontact and noninvasive manner. The device measures the time delay and intensity of the light scattered or reflected from biological tissues, which results in tomographic imaging of their internal structure. This is achieved by scanning tissues at a resolution ranging from 1 to 15 $\mu$m. OCT enables real-time in situ imaging of tissues without the need for biopsy, histological procedures, or the use of X-rays, so it can be used in many fields of medicine. Its properties are not only particularly used in ophthalmology, in the diagnosis of all layers of the retina, but also increasingly in cardiology, gastroenterology, pulmonology, oncology, and dermatology. The basic properties of OCT, that is, noninvasiveness and low wattage of the used light, have also been appreciated in analytical technology by conservators, who use it to identify the quality and age of paintings, ceramics, or glass. Recently, the OCT technique of visualization is being tested in different fields of dentistry, which is depicted in the article.},
