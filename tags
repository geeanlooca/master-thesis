Acquisition rate	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^While in \\ac{SD-OCT} the resampling step is the only possible solution for this issue, \\ac{SS-OCT} enables a hardware approach through a non-uniform clocking of the \\ac{DAQ} device. This is accomplished by extracting a clock signal, called \\emph{k-clock}, by means of an unbalanced \\acf{MZI} which detects the frequency-sweep and generates a sinusoidal signal with a variable frequency. This approach removes the need for the computationally-intensive resampling step, but requires special \\ac{DAQ} devices that can handle external clocks with a wide range of frequencies and duty cycles, which are generally more expensive.  $/;"	b

Axial Resolution	Chapters/Chapter03.tex	/^\\end{equation}$/;"	b
Axial resolution	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^The acquisition speed of \\ac{SS-OCT} systems is dictated by the source sweep repetition rate, that is, the frequency at which the source is able to sweep the entire bandwidth. This parameter is determined by the laser cavity length. In fact, for a given frequency, the spontaneous emission has to build up in order to reach a saturation limit to be correctly amplified by the active region. Shorter cavities with a smaller round-trip generally guarantee higher repetition rates than longer cavities. Novel swept-source designs enable acquisition speeds in the order of 100,000 A-scans per second, with \\ac{FDML} and \\acp{VCSEL} reaching repetition rates above 500 kHz. These high rates make \\ac{SS-OCT} the primary candidate for real-time 3D visualization of \\emph{in vivo} samples, where motion artifacts could hinder image quality. This is possible because the detection schemes is no longer the bottleneck like in \\ac{SD-OCT}, where the slow camera response times limited the overall rate of the system. $/;"	b
Balanced detection	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^When using a $k$-clock to acquire A-scans, the imaging range is also dependant on the path difference of the \\ac{MZI}'s arms, which has to be 4 times the maximum imaging depth, $d_{max}$. A factor of 2 is needed because a reflector positioned at $d_{max}$ will have \\ac{OPD} equal to $\\Delta z = 2d_{max}$ with respect to the reference mirror. The other factor of 2 is needed to satisfy Nyquist's criterion, so that the $k$-clock will have a maximum frequency that is 2 times the beat frequency generated by the reflector at $d_{max}$. $/;"	b

Controlling the mirrors	Chapters/Chapter03.tex	/^The galvo system employed in this thesis work is the Thorlabs GVS002\\footnote{\\url{https:\/\/www.thorlabs.com\/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=GVS002}}, which consists in two 1D silver plated mirrors, the motors that controls them, a detector to measure the mirrors' position  and the servo driver boards that interpret the error signals coming from the detector to correctly drive the motors to the demanded position. A photo of the dual axis motor\/mirror assembly is available in \\autoref{fig:galvo}. A thorough analysis of the electrical circuitry of the system is found in \\cite{Calabrese2017}. $/;"	b

OCT Terminology	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^While we just defined the coherence \\emph{length} of a source, it's important to note that it is a parameter that is directly related to the time coherence and does not describe the phenomenon of spatial coherence. $/;"	s
Objectives	Chapters/Chapter01.tex	/^Apart from the structural imaging of biological tissue, OCT can also be utilized to perform \\emph{functional} imaging, giving the user insights on the different properties of the material under analysis. \\ac{PS-OCT} schemes can measure properties such as birefringence, dichroism and optic axis orientation of the sample \\cite{DeBoer1997}, while \\ac{DOCT} and \\ac{svOCT} are able to estimate the direction and velocity of the blood flow in vessels \\cite{Mahmud2013}. Birefringence measurement has found use in dentistry, specifically in the monitoring of caries lesions and their progression, enabling early detection and preventing the need for surgical intervention \\cite{Fried2002}. $/;"	s
