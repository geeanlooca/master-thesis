Acquisition rate	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^While in \\ac{SD-OCT} the resampling step is the only possible solution for this issue, \\ac{SS-OCT} enables a hardware approach through a non-uniform clocking of the \\ac{DAQ} device. This is accomplished by extracting a clock signal, called \\emph{k-clock}, by means of an unbalanced \\acf{MZI} which detects the frequency-sweep and generates a sinusoidal signal with a variable frequency. This approach removes the need for the computationally-intensive resampling step, but requires special \\ac{DAQ} devices that can handle external clocks with a wide range of frequencies and duty cycles, which are generally more expensive.  $/;"	b

Axial resolution	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^The acquisition speed of \\ac{SS-OCT} systems is dictated by the source sweep repetition rate, that is, the frequency at which the source is able to sweep the entire bandwidth. This parameter is determined by the laser cavity length. In fact, for a given frequency, the spontaneous emission has to build up in order to reach a saturation limit to be correctly amplified by the active region. Shorter cavities with a smaller round-trip generally guarantee higher repetition rates than longer cavities. Novel swept-source designs enable acquisition speeds in the order of 100,000 A-scans per second, with \\ac{FDML} and \\acp{VCSEL} reaching repetition rates above 500 kHz. These high rates make \\ac{SS-OCT} the primary candidate for real-time 3D visualization of \\emph{in vivo} samples, where motion artifacts could hinder image quality. This is possible because the detection schemes is no longer the bottleneck like in \\ac{SD-OCT}, where the slow camera response times limited the overall rate of the system. $/;"	b
Balanced detection	Chapters/Chapter02.tex	/^When using a $k$-clock to acquire A-scans, the imaging range is also dependant on the path difference of the \\ac{MZI}'s arms, which has to be 4 times the maximum imaging depth, $d_{max}$. A factor of 2 is needed because a reflector positioned at $d_{max}$ will have \\ac{OPD} equal to $\\Delta z = 2d_{max}$ with respect to the reference mirror. The other factor of 2 is needed to satisfy Nyquist's criterion, so that the $k$-clock will have a maximum frequency that is 2 times the beat frequency generated by the reflector at $d_{max}$. $/;"	b
