 In truth, O judges, while I wish to be adorned with every virtue, yet there is nothing which I can esteem more highly than the being and appearing grateful. For this one virtue is not only the greatest, but is also the parent of all the other virtues.} \medskip

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\noindent First of all, I would like to thank professor Palmieri, my supervisor, for the opportunity he gave me to work on this project, but mostly for his countless advices which made my job a little easier. \\

\noindent A special thought goes to my class mates Giacomo, Linda and Caterina, with which I shared these last few months as a university student, and the other lab-mates Riccardo, Leonardo, Gianluca, Francesco and especially Marco, whom I could always rely upon. \\

\noindent  I also thank Elena, who was always by my side in the most difficult moments. \\ 

\noindent Finally, I heartily thank my family for the essential role they played in my life up until now. Thank you Annachiara, Mariella and Giancarlo.  \\
